# tweets
"""tweets.py: Connects to the Twitter API and checks how many times each expression from the list given
              by the user (either read from file or entered from the console) was tweeted within the last
              hour. Then the expressions and corresponding number of tweets are written into an SQLite 
              database, and shown on a pie chart."""
